# Project Euler Group Learning

A collection of solutions to Project Euler problems in different languages to be used for learning new language dynamics and approaches to solving problems. Each language will have its own benefits and deficits therefore the solutions will be slightly different based on the language used as long as the spirit of the language is embraced and exploited.

Happy coding!

# Contributing

All solutions should be executable on the command line for consistency. Each language should be easily run via the Makefile `make <language> ###`. As an example:

    $ make js 001

If you are adding a new language to the project please make sure that you also include a Makefile target to execute the new language's solution files.

# TODO

  * Performance profiling - compare performance between and within languages
  * Standardize output of all languages
  * Keep "TODO" up-to-date
  * Learn stuff.
