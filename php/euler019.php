/**
 * Problem: You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.
 *
 * 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
 * Thirty days has September,
 * April, June and November.
 * All the rest have thirty-one,
 * Saving February alone,
 * Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 * And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 * A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.
 * How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
 *
 * Solution: Start with 366 days since our known constant (1.1.1901 == Monday) and
 * loop through each month of each year, dividing by 7 and checking if it is a Sunday.
